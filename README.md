## What is CallWithDoxDialer?

Doximity lets healthcare professionals make phone calls to patients while on the go -- without revealing personal phone numbers. Calls are routed through Doximity's HIPAA-secure platform and relayed to the patient who will see the doctor's office number in the Caller ID. Doximity is currently available to verified physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists in the United States.

This µLibrary lets 3rd-party apps easily initiate calls through the Doximity app.

## Other Platforms

* [Android](https://github.com/doximity/android-dialer-call-lib)

## Usage

### Core Functionality
To initiate a call using Doximity, simply call the `dialPhoneNumber` method on the shared `DoxDialerCaller` instance.
If the Doximity app is not installed, this call will direct the user to Doximity on the App Store.

Most reasonable phone number formats are accepted by the `dialPhoneNumber` method, e.g.:
- using numbers only: `6502333444`
- formatted: `(650)233-3444`
- with a leading international area code: `+1(650)233-3444`

#### Using Swift
```
import CallWithDoxDialer

...

DoxDialerCaller.shared().dialPhoneNumber("4254443333")
```

#### Using Objective-C
```
#import <CallWithDoxDialer/CallWithDoxDialer.h>

...

[[DoxDialerCaller shared] dialPhoneNumber:@"4254443333"];
```

### Icons
The library also includes a version of the Doximity icon appropriate for use inside buttons.
It's available through
- `DoxDialerCaller.shared().dialerIcon()`
- `DoxDialerCaller.shared().dialerIconAsTemplate()` (for use in tinted views)



## Integrating CallWithDoxDialer Into Your App

CallWithDoxDialer supports iOS 15.0+.

First, you must give your app permission to open the Doximity app.

In your app's `Info.plist`, add a new entry with key `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` and value type `Array` if one does not already exist.
Then add an element to the array of type `String` and value `doximity`.


#### Carthage

If you use [Carthage][] to manage your dependencies, simply add
CallWithDoxDialer to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "doximity/CallWithDoxDialer" ~> 1.0
```

If you use Carthage to build your dependencies, make sure you have added `CallWithDoxDialer.framework` to the "_Linked Frameworks and Libraries_" section of your target, and have included it in your Carthage framework copying build phase.

#### CocoaPods

If you use [CocoaPods][] to manage your dependencies, simply add
CallWithDoxDialer to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'CallWithDoxDialer', '~> 1.0'
```

#### Manually
To integrate `CallWithDoxDialer` without a package manager, simply download the following files, and place them anywhere in your project:
- `CallWithDoxDialer/DoxDialerCaller.h`
- `CallWithDoxDialer/DoxDialerCaller.m`
- `CallWithDoxDialer/CallWithDoxDialer.bundle`

If you are trying to reference `DoxDialerCaller` from a swift file, make sure to also add the following to your `PROJECTNAME-Bridging-Header.h` file (auto-generated by Xcode when you add your first Objective-C file to the project):

```#import "DoxDialerCaller.h"```
